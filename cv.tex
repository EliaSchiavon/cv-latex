\section{\textcolor{red}{In brief}}
I'm a data scientist curious about everything, and, in particular, I'm passionate about every topic in the computer science field. Here you can find the links to my github repos and stackexchange profiles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] {\color{black}{\FA \faGithub} \href{https://github.com/Feyn-Man}{user:Feyn-Man}. This is the account I use for experimenting. Also check my \href{https://gist.github.com/Feyn-Man}{gists}.
	\item[] {\color{black}{\FA \faGithub} \href{https://github.com/EliaSchiavon}{user:EliaSchiavon}. This is the account I use for working mainly on private repositories, but sometimes I also commit to public ones.

\begin{entrylist}
	\entry
	{06/2021-\\now}
	{Data science and AI researcher}
	{DeepTrace Technologies}
	{My role here is to implement machine learning and deep-learning algorithm applied mainly to biomedical images such as ultrasound images and Computed Tomography images. The work I conduct often results in scientific publications (see publications section). I'm also responsible for the deployment of the developed software to on-premise or cloud-based solutions.}
	\entry
	{09/2020-\\06/2021}
	{Research fellow}
	{IBFM-CNR (Segrate)}
	{During this fellowship, I focused on the analysis of uterus' ultrasound images. In particular, I applied some classic computer vision techniques to augment the available number of images that will be used after to train a deep-learning algorithm with the final aim of segmenting suspicious masses. This work was conducted as a tutoring activity for a Master's degree thesis in which I was co-advisor.}
	\entry
	{06/2019-\\10/2019}
	{Internship}
	{IBFM-CNR (Segrate)}
	{Developing of algorithms for automatic segmentation of medical images. The activities I conducted during this period were mainly related to my Master's degree thesis work (see Education section).}
