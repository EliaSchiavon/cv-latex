\section{\textcolor{red}{Education}}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
    {2017-2019}
    {M. Sc. in Data Science}
    {University of Milano-Bicocca, Milano}
    {Thesis title: ``Training of an AI-based algorithm for lung nodules segmentation: from medical image processing to deep learning.'' conducted at L.I.T.A (Interdisciplinar Laboratory for Adavanced Technologies), CNR structure in Milan. During this thesis activity I implemented a deep-learning algorithm to automatically segment malignant nodules in lungs images coming from Computed Tomography scans.\\
    Final grade: 110/110 cum laude.}
  \entry
    {2014â€“2017}
    {B. Sc. in Physics}
    {University of Milano-Bicocca, Milano}
    {Thesis title: ``Analysis through equivalent circuit of electrically detected electronic spin resonance spectra" with laboratory experiment conducted at Materials and Spectroscopies for Nanoelectronics and Spintronics laboratory, University of Milano-Bicocca. During this thesis activity I conducted an experiment whith the final aim to analyze the electronic spin resonance spectra on different samples of silicium.\\
